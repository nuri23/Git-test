This time, this place
Misused, mistakes
Too long, too late
Who was I to make you wait?

Just one chance, just one breath
Just in case there's just one left
'Cause you know, you know, you know

That I love you
I have loved you all along
And I miss you
Been far away, for far too long

I keep dreaming you'll be with me
And you'll never go
Stop breathing if I don't see you anymore
